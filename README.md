Primer is a crucial part in PCR (polymerase chain reaction). A good primer pair can ease the process and make it efficient. This primer quality checker will check the quality of a primer pair given by the user and return its quality in different categories. This program will be helpful for students and researchers that work with PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to check the quality of their designed primer.
